1. Random Initial guess
2. Ratify Guess
3. Add ratified guess to guess history
4. If a bull is determined, store digit and position, and remove it from allowed numbers.
5. Create new guess based on history and determined value
	a. If ratified guess has no cows or bulls then reduce allowedNumbers by digits in guess
	b. If guess has cows (and bulls), then iterate order of digits in guess till cows become bulls
		i. Do this one digit at a time
		ii. Each iteration is a guess, and must run through from step 2 down.
	c. If a ratified guess has an unknown bull, iterate through the unknown potential bulls by turning them into a cow 
		i. Do this by swapping unknown potential bull with an allowed number
		ii. Each iteration is a guess, and must run through from step 2 down.
